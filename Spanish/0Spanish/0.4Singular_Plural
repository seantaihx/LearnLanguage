To sum up, making plural nouns in Spanish is pretty straightforward. Based on the noun ending in its singular form, all you need to do is add the right ending. =Letâ€™s recap the main points:

If a noun ends in a vowel, simply add -s to form the plural.
If a noun ends in a consonant, add -es for most cases.
If a noun ends in -z, drop the -z and add -ces.
